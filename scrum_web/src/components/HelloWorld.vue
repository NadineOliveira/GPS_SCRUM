          Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems,
          while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
        </p>

        <p class="subheading font-weight-regular">
          Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.  Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.  This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrumâ€™s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.
